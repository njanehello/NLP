That morning sky gave me a look
So I left while you were sleeping, that's all it took
And I chalked a line south down the coast
Goin' where my thirst was open
For the things that I don't know
Goin' where I wasn't payin' for the hurt that I owe
One half moon sleeping by the creeks
And a woman put me under
Her barn roof for a week
I knew her voice before she spake
I saw a grave dug by a preacher
Just to see what it would make
So hold high how faint your reasons
Don't you forget you come from nothing
That wind is calling my name
And I won't wait
Or I'll never get on
It's not hard to live like a ghost
I just haunt all that I've wanted
And leave what I don't
I dreamt a trail up to the sky
And my brothers built propellers
Just to see how far they'd fly
So hold high how faint your reasons
Your flashing sparrows chasin with them
Don't you forget you come from nothing
That wind is calling my name
And I won't wait
Or I'll never get on
That wind is calling my name
And I won't wait
Or I'll never get on
So hold high how faint your reasons
Hold up high how faint your reasons
Hold high how faint your reasons
That wind is calling my name
And I won't wait
Or I'll never get on

I started working at the second hand
I thought it would make me more colorful
I saw the world as a stitch and patch
I saw the sky as torn grey wool
I started working as a dime store clerk
I thought it would make me the kind to put you first
My only dreams were in fluorescent light
My only goal was to forget what I was worth
I want to see how it takes me
I want to see how the powder burns
Don't want to keep what I can't have more of
Don't want to wait and miss my turn
I started working as a tour guide
I thought it would make me believe my own words
Every patient thought just passed me by
Every truth I said sounded just absurd
I started working at a small town church
I thought it would make me a better man
They said the sins I had would fly away
As if the birds were in the palms of my own hands
I want to see how it takes me
I want to see how the powder burns
Don't want to keep what I can't have more of
Don't want to wait and miss my turn
I want to see how it takes me
I want to see how the powder burns
Don't want to keep what I can't have more of
Don't want to wait and miss my turn

Hey Jojo
Yeah I know your name
I thought I saw you
Jump the Utah train
But I could not say
I could not say
Heard you tried to
Keep your heart on the shelf
Married a woman
Went off and loved someone else
It could be as well
I cannot tell
Oh, no I cannot tell
Hey Jojo
Don't you forget your name
Might try to keep you
From the man you have been
So don't go that way
Don't go that way
Oh 'cause the story I heard
Is that people are bored
And the measures you take
To wrestle with your lord
All the money you take
All the memories you spill
Will he measure your tongue
Will he measure your will
Oh now
One of these mornings
Will be the loudest you hear
You'll write your story
On firecracker paper
And disappear
You disappear
And disappear
And you disappear
Oh 'cause the story I heard
Is that people are bored
And the measures you take
To wrestle with your lord
Are the measures you fake
Whether you're dead or just still
Will he measure your time
Will he measure your will
Oh now
One of these mornings
We'll be, we'll be
One of these mornings
We'll be, we'll be home

----------

Panic in the first beat of the morning
Even what I've got isn't worth offering
If I can't cross the sheets and hold your beat
Talking in the street with who is listening
Nothing that I say is worth remembering
Even faces change- my heart stays the same
Engine in the sky won't let the moment go
Following behind always a second slow
If I'm far away, am I hearing straight- I'm no voice you want to know?
You've been a forest burning no direction
Caught me sleeping smoke in my protection
Your blackened branches drifting through my water-
Are you wrapped up in his arms? I'm rushing faster and faster
Panic in the taste of all that could have been
Even what I thought wasn't worth giving
At least my mind has changed
I've been a forest burning no direction
I tried to hold you, I tried everything but running
My heart is panicking- are you kissing him?
Are you reaching through all your days with him?
Your blackened branches drifting through my water-
Are you over me? Are you? Are? You are
I will not hold you. I will not feel your sway
I will not miss you. I will not think each day
Of summer twilight, your eyes rushing through me deep
I saw my own waters rushing right back to me-
You sitting shotgun, the lost coast calling me
Umpqua Forest, your face just like in my dream…
Are you are you are
Are you are you are
Are you are you are
Are you are you are
Are you are you are
Are you are you are

----------

There are those among us willing
To get by on anything
Hollow hope of what is coming
A lifetime dangled by a string
But this ocean dives so deeply
And this river runs so wide
I won't be counted one among them
Until my soul is satisfied
Brick and brick of buried hunger
Keeping all desire dark
And then we are like lions
We are tearing it apart
There are those among us lying
Saying nothing is for free
And then we are like lions
And we will not leave until we eat
Playing kings and playing peasants
Do we get what we are owed?
An eagle comes and talks of failure
A rabbit offers up its throat
Will they buy even our breathing?
A river strangled by a dam
Less than one percent are taking
So, tell me, who dries up this land?
Is it worse to see no future?
Is it worse to be afraid?
And then we are like lions
Pumping fire in our veins
We are born with a perfect hunger
We are born with a perfect need
And then we are like lions
And we are baring all our teeth
It is coming down the mountain
Fear that holds you like a cold
It wants to settle in your footprints
Keep you still from where you're going
All you think you know of losing
All you doubt of innocence
That big sky still hangs above you
Every day just wants to quit
There's no light you see to guide you
And it scares you just the same
And then we are like lions
Nothing dares get in our way
See your faithless sails drifting
And your truth just cut apart
And then we are like lions
We are golden in our hearts
And then we are like lions
We are standing on two feet
Hanging on the kitchen wall
For everyone to see
Get out your banjo
So we can sing
There are winds that wrap and hold me
There are whispers in the trees
I cannot hold all that is sacred
They are holding onto me
Kiss the years that all are dying
Kiss the face that makes you stay
They are in your rhythms walking
They are showing you the way
Breath and breath above a sickness
Shouting threats upon your life
And then we are like lions
We are fool enough to fight
It will cheat you in the balance
Taking more than left to live
And then we are like lions
We are strong enough to give
And then we are like lions
We are strong enough to give

----------

They're playing our song
They're playing our song
Can you see the light
Can you hear the hum
Of our song
I hope they get it right
I hope we dance tonight
Before we get it wrong
And the seasons will change us new
But you're the best I've known
And you know me
I could not be stuck on you
If it weren't true
I was swimming
My eyes were dark
'Til you woke me
And told me that opening
Is just the start
It was
Now I see you, 'til kingdom come
You're the one I want
To see me for all
The stupid shit I've done
Soil and six feet under
Kept just like we were
Before you knew you'd know me
And you know me
Blooming up from the ground
3 rounds and a sound
Like whispering, you know me
You know me
So this was our song
This was our song
I still see the lights
I can see them
And the crisscross
Of what is true, won't get to us
Cause you know me
I could not give up on you
And the fog of what is right
Won't cover us
Cause you know me
I could not give up a fight
Soil and six feet under
Kept just like we were
Before you knew you'd know me
And you know me
Blooming up from the ground
3 rounds and a sound
Like whispering 'you know me
You know me

----------

Now you don't have a word to call this kind of a year
That made you kneel and beg it to turn you right
Two dead birds underneath the headlights
Every sound they ever made to call out they are alive
Every piece of me that breaks
Trying to keep from the side of doubt
Don't you doubt
Everybody's seen some winter don't you take the dark way out
Don't you doubt
Even your breath is breathing for another one
Don't you just take the dark way out
Thin wind ringing in the silver tines
Yeah, it took you by the throat but it wasn't the killing kind
And now you don't tell it like you used to
Every day left in the dark is going to come back to you
Every hope left in your heart
Is waiting on what you'll do with doubt
Don't you doubt
Everybody's seen some winter don't you take the dark way out
Don't you doubt
Even your blood is beating for another one
Don't you just take the dark way out
Don't you doubt
The reasons are all dead and they're growing in the ground
So why does it give? Why the take? Why the bitter kiss?
Why the me? Why the anything?
Just be the man, be the child, e the cold midnight
Soaking the bones of this town
In the breath, in the beak
In the honey taken from every green thing giving sweet
In the call, in the pull, in the want and want
In the sound even your own body knows
All there is, seed and shell
Your hands are lined with all that they haven't held

----------

Oh from the first that the line got drawn
It was poisoning the land it was on
One red thread through the middle of a song
My only one, my only one
I can remember the age that I was
But not that story that pumped in my blood
When you were the savior
And I was the taker of
Oh, where I was
Oh but man, oh man, you can do what you want
Oh man, oh man, you can do what you want
The only line that is true is the line you're from
I have to say there was a mile or two
I had the itch to fly and I flew
Now at best we would make our dreams
With something used
With something used
From the minute that the line got drawn
I couldn't see straight to you for nothing
Now me, I'm the poisoning one
Yeah I'm the one
I am the...
Oh but man, oh man, you can do what you want
Oh man, oh man, you can do what you want
The only line that is true is the line you're–
Oh man, oh man, you can do what you want
Oh man, oh man, you can do what you want
The only line that is true is the line you're from
The only line that is true is the line you're from

----------

In shadow
In dark
In cold wind, open up your heart
'Cause time brushes
Your face
And one loved them- every new shape
One loved them for what could not get left behind or washed away
Some were seasons
Some just days
I'm bringing nothing with me I mean to save:
This faint sweetness
This wick of light
This white apple full of bites
A white apple full of what
Has slipped away from me;
Full of flesh sweet as memory;
Full of hope grown from a fallen tree;
Full of a life I can't just let myself believe
So if I haunt you
If I do
If my shadow leans up on you too
No good intentions
Or ways I talk
I'll just leave a light lit for you to walk
I'll leave a light lit for you to walk

----------

Our time is ever on the road
The ride is in what we make
I walked a year to hear a howl in this give and take
But hear it this way- hear it this way
Alright!
And war is in our hearts
And blood is in the land we love
We keep breaking our backs
Hoping that it gives enough
Oh! But what do you need?
What do you need?
Oh man, it's ladders to the sky
Building up a high-rise
Oh man, we won't last long
But we're giving it our best try
Don't you know you're alive? 
You know you're alive
And none of us stay, 
The day we're born 'till then we-
And tonight I'm in love with everybody on this city bus
I feel the push and pull
Keep saying that it doesn't mean much
Oh! But what do you see?
What do you see?
And everybody on the street is singing like it's Sunday
But we keep inside and our looks stay at bay
Ahhh, ahhh
And we don't know what's left
But we feel it's coming back soon
And so we're standing in the street staring at a blood-red moon
We are the tide. 
We are the tide, and none of us stay, 
The day we're born 'till when we

----------

Don't move an inch
Listen for a singing
Hitting in your bones like they were forks
If you hear what I hear
Don't just sit there
We are only strumming water
On this most unlikely chord
You got blown shore to shore
Not quite sailing
Riding on the trade-winds of age
Things blow in
Don't just cast them
You say it now, what you want to stay
I was once on a long boat
Star mapping the night routes
Lightening the load
Just in case
Things float in to be taken
If you don't know by now, what will stay?
So don't move an inch
Don't move a single second
Until the shade behind your thoughts is not confused
Cause I felt your itch
I know the scent as well as any
Clotting your garden
Of paint or pollen
Brick in your mortar
Petals to soak in
On the cracks
Thicker or finer
Milk in your water
Black in your primer
Wood in your brush
Now I am your cloth
Whatever you want-
The best is upon us
Its a finicky muse
With only potential
To choose

----------

Salting the silence, boiling my blood
Giving and honest is not thick enough
And now have you gone easy, let your lines get caught?
Some sink and some carry and you will not
No, you will not know
If it holds you
'till you set straight where you're going to
You'll not know ‘till it breaks us
Pulls you under, if you'll give up
You'll not know
For what is this comfort?  Is it asking too much
When you hold me in hunger and I feel your touch?
When I feel your touch
I know
Where the day ends.  All my lines meet
The horizons
I know, I know, I know
I can do this and the hard days
I won't miss
I know, I know, I know, I know
Like it's scarred in
Where my place is; where I'm going
I know, I know, I know
I'm a lost one
And it's too late.  I'm far gone

----------

I was in between
I was an offering
I was a burning branch
Close to feeling tall
Almost a free fall
I was made of chance
And when the colors bleed
Mix up my memories
When I write it new
I'll just be a sound you heard
I'll be a foreign word
That's meaning your type of blue
And I'll leave that here with you
Oh, our lines will blur
But you've got a face like no other
I'll keep it where I see things right
Oh, a darkness comes
But you've got a way like no other one
I'll keep it where my black keeps light
Make me a mirror of
All that I cannot love
Let me hold the cast
Of my favorite years
The truth how they gave me here
And let that be last
Let that be my last
Oh, our lines will blur
But you've got a face like no other
I'll keep it where I see things right
Oh, a darkness comes
But you've got a way like no other one
I'll keep it where my black keeps light
In a darkness I do not know
If it takes me, I'll feel you glow
In a darkness I do not know
Oh, our lines will blur
But you've got a face like no other
I'll keep it where I see things right
Oh, a darkness comes
But you've got a way like no other one
I'll keep it where my black keeps light

----------

I am the eagle
I live in high country
In rocky cathedrals that reach to the sky
And I am the hawk
And there's blood on my feathers
But time is still turning, they soon will be dry
And all those who see me
And all who believe in me
Share in the freedom I feel when I fly
Come dance with the west wind and touch on the mountain tops
Sail over the canyons and up to the stars
And reach for the heavens and hope for the future
All that we can be
All that we can be
All that we can be
Not just what we are

----------

The thrill here is quicker than you'd think
The way some jet-lagged bar kept pouring the wine
From over their heads then sit back down again
Four times is once too much for luck
And that's how many times the clock struck
I wandered home saying your name
The arches here were built cause they don't fall
The cathedrals to make you feel small
That you might find your small soul
But leave the preaching to the president
The crowd cheers. His eyes get wet
I'm full as it is, I'm full as it is
So don't feed me more
You'll be having my head, big as a birthday
Cause I left all my doubts on the airplane
I didn't know, I didn't know I'm not in control
I didn't know, I'm not invincible
Now maybe some things are better left unsaid
But if you wanted to test that out, well, yeah, I guess, I could've said
But there were nights in bars that I recall
Your breath was courage laced with alcohol
You leaned in, you said
"Make music with the chatter in here
And whisper all the notes in my ears."
I didn't know, I didn't know the weight of my tongue
I didn't know, I didn't know what I'd done
The lights here are softer than you'd think
The dim lit peacocks in the trees
Are hiding their eyes and their beauty, like me
But if my eyes were on my back
I know what I'd be looking at
Through every shade of browns and greens
I didn't know, I didn't know it was nothing new
I didn't know, I didn't know it was you

----------

Let all things be as they should
Let my heart just drift like wood
And will I break or will I bow
If I can not let it go
Feel that sun just hold you right
Leave you burning down the night
Feel that wind light up your soul
If you can not let it go
If I can not let it go
Up and in with the reasons
Blown out like a ghost
We came with the best lines
Told them like jokes
If I could've known then
We were dying to get gone
I can't believe we get just one
When your thirst can come to me
I am a river for the sea
And you can hold me in your sway
I give myself away
Will I give myself away?
Up and in with the reasons
Blown out like a ghost
We came with the best lines
Told them like jokes
If I could've known then
We were dying to get gone
I can't believe we get just one
Let all things be as they will
Let my heart beat itself still

----------

I buried a bone
And darling you don't know him
Darling you don't know him
Darling you don't know
And just where you are
Might be the right place
It might be that sweet space
But you don't know
Now look me in the head
I've got nothing on my mind
I've been waiting for you
All this time
And I'd seen a path turn to an old road
But the secret's too slow
And we're too fast
Look me in the mouth
I've got nothing in my smile
I've been waiting for you
You're just my style
Look me in the gut
I've got fear for my own name
I'd dig it up for you
If you'd do the same
I buried a bone
And darling you don't know him
Darling you don't know him
Darling you don't know

----------

Remember the world
Living in the half
That you cannot see
Been walking along
The thinning tide
And stepping in too deep
Watching water thread my sleeve
What did I pull from underneath
Tie it down
Wait it out
Hope our memories hold
Lead white nail
Driven down
A hundred years ago
Feeling wheels on my old road
Feeling bad for what I sold
I had a dream you were two towns from me
Got to sleep, spent the whole night running
Dive in gold
Wet their breath
And live in between
Hollow bones
Knowing both
What they want and what they need
How I want that mystery
Let me dive 'til I believe
I had a dream you were two towns from me
Got to sleep, spent the whole night, whole night
Had a dream were nothing more than
Caught up in our own lives, Honey

----------

Poor boy
Why don't you try getting water?
Poor boy
Why don't you try getting sleep?
I think if one of us is going to suffer
Why shouldn't it be me?
Poor boy
Your wife is in hard labor
The rhythm you know
Is pulsing and drifting to the grave
When you come to
You'll be asking yourself just one question
Was I always this way?
Was I always this way?
Think back a year
When everything stood at the surface
But bandage you cuts cause you don't know what swims underneath
Hold tight
The bondage of this life is slipping
Why shouldn't it be me?
Why shouldn't it be me?
When I come back
You'll be the brightest star
In the black
When there are days
That you want the call we're all waiting for
Think back
Poor boy
Your wife is in hard labor
Go buy the flowers you'll leave on its grave
You went with the goal of movement
Now one thing is different:
You don't want to change
I don't want to change

----------

Picking up sound on the interstate
I am my breath
Letting in waves
There will be time when the sleep I'm in
Covers me cold
Covers me thin
I know I'll wake up old
Forgetting which box this is in
How I will keep you
Uh huh...uh huh
Uh huh...uh huh
Just how I left you
Our daughter once told me I know a lot
Now I'm strutting off with more than I've got
A hitchhiker told me I don't talk a lot
Made me feel fine
Made me quiet
If you had said it right
Instead of painting words white...
How I would keep you
Uh huh...uh huh
Uh huh...uh huh
Just how I left you
Uh huh...uh huh
Come on say it right
Uh huh...uh huh
Come on say it right. Come on say it right
Come on say it right. Come on say it right
Come on say it right. Come on say it right
Come on say it right

----------

If ever you should die I know I'll shave my head
Its not a morbid thought, I mean it out of love
Come back daddy
Come back to the bitter end
Come back daddy
Hounds-tooth coats and vitamins
If ever the sea claims the cities on the coast
Before the last bridge blows I know I will propose
Come back baby
Armed with paddles in your hands
Come back baby
Come back to the bitter end
The soil on the spade will be my love and hurt
The cellphone satellites will hurl to the earth
To the earth
But in the moon
There is half of our shadow on
From in the womb
There are strange sounds on the water front
And it takes a monk
To lose it all
Come back baby
Come back to the bitter end
Come back everything that caught up in the plans
Come back baby
Come back to the bitter end
Come back everything that put salt in the sand

----------

I hear the train all night, sound of its wind blowin' through
Our subtle lives...
And I have a job to do, walking these cars, walking all this sleep
To get to you
But I don't feel you stir beside me
And you're not in my morning hours
Some ties are made to break; some stalks grow high and green to rot away
And feel the weight
And these lines tell the truth, these city veins answer all they do
So, could you keep me in the pulses?
Could you keep me in the sound?
I got wise and I got old
Not once, not once did I fold
So don't you now
Maybe you bet on me, while we were still young enough to know
What to believe
But for every year you took, for every soft breath or loving look
Believe me
And don't keep me like you have me
And don't kiss me like you don't
I got wise and I got old
Not once, not once did I fold
So don't you now
Some land holds a home; some of my years only hold... me to roam
But I tell myself it's true, you see a home, you see a man
You see it too
And I say don't you know you have her?
Go on kiss her now you boy
I got wise and I got old
Not once, not once did I fold
So don't you now
I got wise and I got old
Not once, not once did I fold
So don't you now

----------

The stars wash over me
So far away that I can barely breathe
From where I lay
Never have I been so far
From home o'er the years I was cut
From sand and rain
I'm calling
Through ebb and flow
I'm calling
Whichever way goes
Desert rock and roads were up
Carried dried blood that's on the breeze
Make me move
Blowing through my face again
Blowing between the bones that shake and knock
Me through and through
I've been away so long I lost you
My love
The song inside
You give me anything you want to
I'm back
To keep you right
Oh, to keep you right
My heart longs for too much
Mine eyes have hardly seen enough
To know it's near
Never does it stop and slow
I press my ear against the ground
To know the song it sings
I'm calling
Fear running through
I'm calling
What more can I do
Tell me what more can I do
I've been away so long I lost you
My love
The song inside
You give me anything you want to
Now I'm back
To keep you right
You give me anything you want to
Now I'm back
To keep you right
Oh to keep you right
Oh to keep you right
Oh to keep you right

----------

In your old room
Where we caught you
Stepping through some old song
You said came from
Where your going
A lady read it in you palm
Down at the 12th Avenue market
Now promise you will not forget
You are going
'Til it's gone
Screen went blue
Before I touched you
And my ride went home
All the photos came out lonely
But we're not alone
Talking of everything we could not hold
I was stupid of thinking of east coast already
Now it's gone
There are things I cannot forget
I wish none had happened yet
There are some things I cannot forget
We were stronger than the preachers
We were wiser than the law
We took off sleeping by the river
And the beaches in your car
Up where you taught me how to drive a stick
And told me your family secret
You were scared
I was caught
Why'd you stay behind
Packing for the trip?
Why'd you ask me to be the one
First through your lips?
I was awkward and I could not hear
Your body through my body's fear
We were going to hell
There are things I cannot recall
There are some things that would risk it all
Now these are the things we cannot recall on
These are the things I cannot recall

----------

Holy road we are on tonight
Catch as catch can till we get it right
Always... in this dark light
Always
Tell me more than what you can guess
Feel like thunder then quick to forget
Always looking for what is not yet
Always
Oooohh...
Lock the keys in my house tonight
Hit the steps for the morning light
Always looking for a new light
Always

----------

It was a wild idea to start
We were lost in an hour, everything came apart
In the middle of nowhere
Oh man, hey look where we are
I know your teeth are shut and proud
But there are rhythms in the city make your head feel loud
Uh-huh
So get it out, get it out
You are a long ways upriver from home
Right here this water is mean, but it's the same as your own
Better swim for your life
It's both at the same time
It was a wild idea to start
A drip on the head got it wet in the heart
And it looked just like a river but was a freeway in the dark
In the dark
Were you always so ready?
Were you always so ready?
I never want to call it off
I never want to call it off
I've never been that ready
I've never been this ready
In my life

----------

If I came to you in thunder
Not one shiver in my heart
Black as crow against the white lies of the morning
Trying to tell themselves apart
All apart, all apart
And if it's everything you're waiting on
I know that's easy to do
If your light is shining in another's arms
Well I can't say it isn't true
It isn't true, it isn't true
But just to see the sky split its arms open wide
It was enough
If I came to you in sunlight
Not one reason in my heart
Like the colors sleeping underneath your garden
Trying to pull themselves apart
All apart, all apart
And for every year just wondering
If I could ever fall enough
If I had grabbed your hand in thunder
While everything was struck
Well I was struck, I was struck
Well I was struck, I was struck, I was struck
But just to see the milk of stars right through your eyes
It was enough

----------

Blessed with your line, you are blessed at the hook
That is pulling at all yet revealed
You don't aim to shoot, you don't aim to win
You just know the way there by feel
For all you could have been
And who you are still
For all you could have been
And who you are
One hand on your faith, one hand on a color
That pulls the whole world to your heart
And I'm wanting to hold all that I still know in you
While this is still who we are
To know just where you are
And where you're not this far
To know just where you are
And where you're not
Cut from a hope, we're cut from the same metal
That blooms its veins in the ground
I have loved you in the body, in the breath, in the eyes
In the air still speaking your sound
Don't know just where you are
And where you're not now
Don't know just where you are
And where you're not now
To know just where you are
And where you're not now
To know just where you are
And where you're not

Wake up, my brother
Lift your covers and see your breath
Look out our window
The sky looks hollow and dark as our own death
Bones of our bodies, seeds of our tall trees
And years all frayed
Oh, what will I become, when the pale light brings a dawn
When I can't hear you say
"Brother, you don't have to fight
So hard, it eats you up inside
Breathe and feel the sun
You can see it in the shallow tide
You can see it in our mother's eyes
Here, all for what has come
All for what has come"
Flock and feather
Tied into each other
And we're born in, burning
To return to one another
Flock and feather
Tied into each other
And we're born in, burning
To return to one another
Wake up, my sister
Doesn't the water sound nearer
Your road farther away
And no, it don't come easy
There is a wave's weight over me
But I can't hear you say
"You don't have to be the only one
You don't have to be the golden sun
Breathe and let it set
You can see it in the way we need
You can breathe it in the cedar leaves
Blowing smoke and sweat
We can see it in the pale light
We can see it in each other's eyes
Here, all for what is yet
All for what is yet"

Even the robin that cuts the dawn
Even his sound knows which side he's on
Nothing that stays where it has been
In the black
And the light is a candle on my screen
Flickers the real love, the same old dream
Holding me in this middle moon
Looking back
I won't let it drink me down
Like a secret
I won't give in any more
Than I've given
No matter how or hard enough
I'm still gonna drink from that broken cup
Yeah, it knows which side I'm on
I have done wrong, I've done wrong, I've done wrong
And that weight will follow me
But that weight is the world's
The world's not mine
It is the place where I am
And I have lost, I have lost, I've lost
And that won't let go of me
But that story's not me
It's just who I can't change
And not who I can
I don't see the desert for its sand
I don't see the water for dry land
All that I love has turned to fuel for the fire
It's gonna burn me with its touch
It's gonna fill my loving cup
It knows which side I'm on
I have done wrong I've done wrong I've done wrong
And that weight will follow me
But that weight is the world's
The world's not mine
It is the place where I am
And I have lost, I have lost, I've lost
And that won't let go of me
But that story's not me
It's who I can't change
And not who I can
That story's not me
It's who I can't change
And not who I can
No, that story's not me
It's just who I can't change
And not who I am
Oh, oh it keeps me from
Oh, oh it keeps me from
Oh, oh it keeps me from

----------

Seeing is believing
How many moons has that darkness hid?
All my good friends
All my dead ends
Some to think and some to forgive
Oh my father
I've got your fever
I'm holding my breath in
Your wishing well
This is just time's thirst
This is just everything hurts
You feel your own breath
The rest is hard to tell
It's gonna lift your eyes up
All you haven't seen just yet
All you're holding to be
It's gonna lift, you rise up
No, it's not a lot to hold
But this life is gonna make you believe
Oh, I know it will
Seeing is believing
How many moons has our own darkness hid?
Hear the train brakes
Hear all your old voices shake
As you are saying it right now, just like it is
It's gonna lift your eyes up
Al you haven't seen just yet
All you're holding to be
It's gonna lift, you rise up
No, it's not a lot to hold
But this life is gonna make you believe
Oh, this life is gonna make you believe
Oh, this life is gonna make you believe
Oh, I know it will, I know it will, I know it will

----------

Are you quiet as your name
On the day before it came?
Are you in the meaning
That it sang in me with its sound?
Oh, what name are you saying now?
Every dream stuck in my mouth
Talking north and talking south
You said you believed me
As the sun will rise without a doubt
Oh, are you believing me now?
Oh, you are a color now I keep with the dawn
Oh, I'm gonna keep it right until it's gone
Oh, you are a color now I keep with the dawn
Oh, oh
Is the creek where you first swam
Bending all your breaths to sand?
If I looked in its mirror
Washing over me
Bending me down?
Oh, you are a color now I keep with the dawn
Oh, it's gonna get me back where I belong
Oh, you are a color now I keep with the dawn
Oh, you are a color now I keep with the dawn
Oh, oh
